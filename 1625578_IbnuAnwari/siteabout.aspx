                      A Story to tell before opening a business; the first intention actually was only for family use. 
                      It was for gathering session which provide a design of family signature which ressemble as Islamic Cultures. 
                      Signature logo were created with Arabic Word Calipgraphy.
                      As the pure honey was given to family gathering session with other related sibling.
                      On the event; the sibling were feel suprised upon the "Honey" that give a good tastes.
                      And telling that; "With your organic honey, people might be interested to drink it; you should advertise your product to peoples".
                      With the ideas, Ibnu's tried to discuss with the family by the decision, 
                      other than giving the organic made for family healthy supplement; the best thing to do is by doing a business can be more profitables.
